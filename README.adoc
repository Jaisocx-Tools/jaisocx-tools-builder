= JAISOCX TOOL BUILDER

== AIM OF THE PROJECT

=== typescript modules development, local and synched to npm registry
The project was started to provide the modular typescript development,
with the ability to keep source code well structured in npm registry,
however being able to develop a new typescript tool,
and at once fix bugs or add new features in other own typescript modules, published on npm registry,
keeping dependencies not broken and centralized.

=== js files use in .html files the easiest way
Another aim of the project is to prettify the transpiled .js results of typescript sources,
and being able to use the prettified .js builds both for web ui tools in .html pages without any additional builds required,
when published at a http server,
and when in files explorer context menu over an .html file "Open with ..." =&gt; browser.

Why? to be able to test a .js tool in each environment, 
be able at once to check out modifying possibilities in the .js code,
